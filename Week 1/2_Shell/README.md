# MyShellScript.ps1 README FILE

## Discription

This is my first attempt at writting a shell script.

I like to have my Desktop folder as clean as possible but often I find myself with many files in it as I use it as easy-to-access space where I can dump files I'm currently working on, and as a result it often gets "polluted" with all kind of files.

This script aims to help me keep my Desktop tidy by moving all the files that are currently in the Desktop folder to a new location in order to be properly organized later on.

This is achieved by moving all the files and folders in the Desktop folder to ~\Documents\Organize\ and then to a folder name with the date in which the operation was performed.
