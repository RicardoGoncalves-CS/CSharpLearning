Welcome to my personal repository for Sparta Tech 205 C# Developer training!

Here you can find the files created during the course of my training with Sparta. 

I'm always open to advice and suggestions on how to improve, be it in terms of code, communication, structure, language or any other aspect relevant to my professional and/or personal development, so I truly welcome and am grateful for any feedback, suggestion or advice that could help me.

Below you can find a _**table of contents**_ with hyperlinks to the appropriate folders to help navigate my repository.

The _**table of contents**_ is organised by week which contain the topics covered during that week.

This repository will be updated throughout the duration of the training.

**NOTE: Each week folder contain notes on the topics covered during that week. The notes in each of these folders are organised by the order it was covered during the lessons.**
